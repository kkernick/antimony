# Antimony

Antimony is a [fast](./docs/Speed), [powerful](./docs/Profiles), [customizable](./docs/Configurations), and [secure](./docs/SECCOMP) sandboxing application. Itâ€™s dynamic dependency resolution, and extendable design makes it trivial to sandbox applications and seamlessly integrate in the shell and desktop environment.
